        In addition to being the largest shopping centre in British Columbia, Metropolis at Metrotown is also home to SilverCity Metropolis, the largest movie theatre in Burnaby.<br><br>No matter what you’re in the mood for, or who you’re catching a flick with, chances are, you’ll find a movie that matches your taste at Silvercity Metropolis. <br><br>
 

If you’re a comic book fan:<br><br>
Kingsman: The Secret Service: Based on a comic book by the same name, Kingsman: The Secret Service is about a secret spy organization which recruits a street kid into the agency’s ultra-competitive training program.  Meanwhile, a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius…<br><br>
If you want to watch a classic fairy-tale:<br><br>
Cinderella: One of the most classic fairy-tales of all time is Cinderella. After the sudden passing of young Ella’s father, she is at the mercy of a wicked new family: a cruel stepmother, and two jealous stepsisters.  After an encounter in the woods with a kind and charming palace apprentice (who, unbeknownst to Ella, is actually a Prince), Ella finally feels she has finally met her kindred soul.<br><br>
When an open invitation is sent out by the Palace for all maidens to attend a ball, Ella hopes to run into the stranger in the woods again.  However, her stepmother forbids her to attend and rips her dress apart.  Will Ella ever get her happily ever after?<br><br>

If you’re in the mood for an action-packed flick:<br><br>
The Divergent Series: Insurgent: Based on a book series by the same name, Insurgent is the second movie in the trilogy.  The film takes place in post-apocalyptic Chicago, where main characters Tris and Four are fugitives on the run, desperately trying to escape from the power-hungry Erudite elite.   What will be the fate of humanity?<br><br>

If you're ready for a scare:<br><br>
It Follows: Rather than the fall season being about school, boys and weekends at the lake, 19 year old Jay has disturbing visions and can't shake off the feeing that someone...or something...is after her.  After watching this flick, you’ll be looking over your shoulder for days, and jumping at every creaky door or thump in the night.<br><br>

If you’re with young children:<br><br>
The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water: Life is swell in the underwater world of Bikini Bottom, until the top-secret recipe for Krabby Patties is stolen.  The lovable and hilarious SpongeBob SquarePants finds that he must join forces with his perpetual adversary Plankton and head out of water to battle the pirate Burger Beard, who has his own plans for the delicious delicacies.<br><br>
